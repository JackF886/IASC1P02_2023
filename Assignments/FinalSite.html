    <h2>Website Fundamentals</h2>

    <div id="text-content">
      <h3> HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</h3>
      <p>HTML is the coding language most commonly associated with websites and the World Wide Web. While it's not the only language used to create websites, it is fundamental to a websites existence. HTML is responsible for the structure and content within a website; the meat and bones of a website. Unlike more commonly known languages such as Java, Python and other "logic" based languages, HTML uses tags to enclose various elements. With the additional attributes available, it is commonly paired with CSS and JS to create a more dynamic and interactive page.</p>
      <br />

      <h3> CSS - Cascading Style Sheet</h3>
      <p>Cascading style sheets are not commonly used on their own. Rather, they are used to complement HTML and its elements. While the language does not add any actual content, it is known as a "styling language" which can adjust the appearance, format, spacing and layouts of HTML elements. Rather than the traditional box layout, CSS aims to make websites flexible, allowing for responsive screens and the use of columnar layouts. Furthermore, with advanced CSS, animations and transformations can be added to further enhance a website's aesthetic.</p>

      <h3> JS - JavaScript</h3>
      <p>Java - but cooler? No! While they both share similar names, they are very different languages and used for completely different goals. Unlike Java, which is an OOP language, JS is a DOM (Document Object Model). This means that JS is often used to create interactivity between the user and the webpage itself, allowing for some pretty awesome features. Additionally, JS is extremely versatile, often being used to program mobile apps and frameworks too. Overall, JS is a widespread tool to create both engaging and dynamic online experiences. </p>
