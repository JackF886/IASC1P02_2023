    <h2>CSS Introduction</h2>

    <div id="text-content-css">
      <h3>Syntax</h3>
      <p>The syntax used in CSS is quite different than other languages as there is no actual content that's associated with the code. A style sheet often comes empty, and the programmer can add a combination of selectors, separators and functions to target specific elements in the HTML and modify it. The most common way to do this is to have the desired class, ID or tag preceding a pair of curly braces that enclose the styles the programmer wishes to apply. Within those curly braces are contained functions and attributes used to make each and every website that much more visually appealing. Like most languages used, a semicolon is used at the end of each line of code (not white space), and colons used to specify the attributes of functions.</p>


      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>Functions are at the heart of CSS, being responsible for and making up the bulk of CSS content. While the information on functions can be conveyed for much longer and further in depth, it's important to define and understand them first. A function is code that holds some sort of property that can be passed a value to specify and apply that property to an element. In CSS, it is commonly used for changing the font size or even the color of the webpage. Red itself is not a function, but color is since it possesses a property that can be specified by a value.</p>

      <br/>
      <h3>Selectors</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">+</span> : Known as the "next sibling" selector</li>
          <li><span class="bold">~</span> : Known as the "subsequent sibling" selector</li>
          <li><span class="bold">*</span> : Used to select all of the tagged elements. Be careful when using this as it is common to target unintended elements!</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Combination of Selectors</span>: Selectors can be combined with one another to create more specific designs, or to style multiple selected elements</li>
          <li><span class="bold">#</span> : Used to target tags that have been assigned an ID in the html</li>
          <li><span class="bold">.</span> : Used to target tags that have been assigned a class in th html</li>
          <li><span class="bold">,</span> : Used to apply the styling in the enclosed curly braces to multiple selectors</li>
          <li><span class="bold">></span> : Used to select a specific tag with a specific parent</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sliding Text</h3>
      <p id="ani-1">The following code uses more advanced CSS concepts. While it is out of the scope of an introduction to the language, I always felt that it's encouraging and inspiring to see the end of the road. As a result, the following text being read has been animated to fly in from the right of your screen! This is done through a combination of concepts, mainly the use of CSS's animate and keyframes functionality. It allows the user to pick an element to edit and define properties too. As the name keyframes suggests, they work with a beginning and ending "snapshot", dividing the animation into frames based on the predetermined duration of an action.
      </p>
      <button id="startAnimationButton">Animate</button>


      <h3 class="move">Panning Text</h3>
      <p id="ani-2">Similar to the concept above, the very text you are reading will fly in from the right of your screen to the left. However, this animation is more involved, adding in a third "snapshot" for the animation to transition between. Additionally, the manipulation of the text's size, from growing and then shrinking helps clearly illustrate the frame data within an animation. While it is still quite simple in terms of possible animations, I feel it's important to show the "next step" in animations. Such a small step can make such a drastic change in the appearance and visual impact of the animation. Personally, it interests me and makes me imagine all the possibilities too.
